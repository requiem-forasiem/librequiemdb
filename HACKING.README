This directory and its children contain LibRequiemDB, a library for using
the Requiem database.

Before you start modifying anything for real, you should probably join
the requiem google group and send a mail describing what you want to 
do and how you want to do it so you don't waste time working on something we 
can't integrate. This also allows us to keep track of what's being worked on 
so efforts aren't duplicated.

Please also read the information in the file LICENSE.README.
