RequiemDB Library (http://requiem-forasiem.github.com/)


RequiemDB Library Overview
========================

The RequiemDB Library provides an abstraction layer upon the type and the format
of the database used to store IDMEF alerts.
It allows developers to use the Requiem IDMEF database easily and efficiently without worrying about SQL,
and to access the database independently of the type/format of the database.
